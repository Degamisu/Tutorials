// Java is a language that is widely used for developing applications. It has a rich standard library and supports object-oriented programming.
// We can begin by making a "Hello World" example.

// This is a Java program that prints "Hello World" to the console.
public class HelloWorld {
 // The main method is the entry point of a Java program.
    public static void main(String args) {
 // This line prints the string "Hello World" to the console.
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}

// Now, let's make this program more interesting and add some variables.

// In this version of our program, we will store the words "Hello"
.
 class HelloWorld { // The main method is the point of a Java.
    public void main(String args) {
// This is a variable that stores the word "Hello".
        String greeting = "Hello"
// This line prints the greeting and a space, followed by the word "World" to the console.
        System.out.println(greeting + " World");
    }
