; This is an example of the 6502 assembly language.
; The 6502 assembly language is commonly used in the Nintendo Entertainment System.
; The 6502 CPU was made in the mid 1980s.

; This example is a simple "hello world" code.

; Hello, World! for 6502

; Memory map:
; $0000 - $00FF: Zero page
; $0100 - $01FF: Stack
; $0200 - $07FF: Program
; $0800 - $0BFF: Screen memory
; $0C00 - $0FFF: Color memory

; Program start
*=$0200

; Initialize variables
start:
    lda #$00
    sta $00
    sta $01

; Print "Hello, World!" to screen
print:
    lda message,x
    beq done
    sta $0400,x
    inx
    jmp print

done:
    ; Halt
    jmp done

; Data
message:
    .text "Hello, World!"
    .byte 0

; This seems like a LOT. Lets break it down.
; First we initialize the zero-page ($00-$0f) and stack ($10-$1b).
; We then set up our program counter (PC) at $0200. The PC is an important register that tells the CPU where to look for instructions.
; Then we have our program code which is stored at $0200-$07ff. The program starts with 'sta' (store accumulator), writing the value of x into $04
; We then jump to our main routine (labelled 'start') which is located at $0200.
; From there, we enter a loop that prints each character of the string 'message' to the screen starting at location $0400.
; The program starts by setting up some registers with values of $00 and $01. These are not used yet but will later on store addresses or other information.
; In this routine we set up some registers with initial values of $00 and $01. These are used as counters for our string printing loop.
; In this routine, we copy the string "Hello, World!" into RAM starting at $0400.
; The X register is used as an index for copying the characters one by one. When the end of the string is reached, the Z flag will be set and we'll branch to ' The X register is used as an index for writing to that location. When the source byte is zero
; To print the message, each character is stored one after another in that location.
; When there are no more characters left to store ($90), we branch to label 'done'.
; At 'done', nothing happens because we're halted by jmp done.
