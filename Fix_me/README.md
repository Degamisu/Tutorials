# Fix-me's!

A fixme is a script with intentional bugs. They are used for practicing your proficiency in debugging and fixing code.

## Installation

In order to edit the fixmes, you must first install them.

This can be done with:

```bash
type -p curl >/dev/null || (sudo apt update && sudo apt install curl -y)
curl -fsSL https://cli.github.com/packages/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg | sudo dd of=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg \
&& sudo chmod go+r /usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg \
&& echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg] https://cli.github.com/packages stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/github-cli.list > /dev/null \
&& sudo apt update \
&& sudo apt install gh -y
gh repo clone Degamisu/Tutorials/Fix_me
```

Then open the fixmes with your prefered `IDE`
