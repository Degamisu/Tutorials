// C++ is a very hard language to learn. This tutorial provides the basics.

// We can start by adding the include names.
// Include <iostream> for input and output streams, which are used in this example. 
#include <iostream> 
// Namespaces are used to avoid naming conflicts between different libraries or code snippets. The "std" namespace is the default.
using namespace std;  

// the int main() function is where execution of program begins. It returns an integer value that represents the exit status of the application
int main()   {      
    // The "cout" syntax is used to display text on screen. It stands for "Character Output".
    // The << operator is used to send data (text or numbers) to cout. Think of it like arrows pointing to the direction where the data should go to!
	cout << "Hello World!";     
    // Finally we can end the script with a "}"
}
