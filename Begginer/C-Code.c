// This tutorial will teach you the basics of C code.
// C code was made in the  1970s and is used for systems programming, which involves writing Higher-level programs
// The term "High Level Languages" describes how C is structured.  
// High-Level Language (HLL) refers to a programming language that abstracts away many details , making it easier for programmers to write and understand software applications. 
// There are other, more complex versions of C, like C++ and C#.

// It is a simple program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

#include <stdio.h>  // Include standard input/output functions

int main()      // Main function where the program starts execution
{
    printf("Hello, World!\n");   // Print "Hello, World!" to the console
    // \n is used for moving to next line
    return 0;     // Return success (0) from main function
    }

// Now, this is only a basic example. I use C code for programming Sega Genesis programs. Although the SG is programmed in M68K,
// There is a library called "SGDK" that allows C code to be used in development of those games!
